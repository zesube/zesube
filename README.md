## Hi there 👋 I'm Zawadi

🌱 A student based in Indiana, USA, studying software development with an interest in full-stack and robotics. 
💻 Currently working towards becoming a developer with a main focus in robotics enigneering with a passion and interest in medical technology.

Open to collaborating on cool projects. DM if interested in collaborating. I love and enjoy music. The 2010s are my vibe for music, with some traditional music as well. I have recently been interested in posting on Instagram about tech and random life stories. 🎶📚 I am a singer who enjoys singing, and I love books a lot.
