## Hi there 👋 I'm Zawadi

🌱A student based in Indiana, USA, studying software development with a focus on full-stack. 
💻I truly enjoy designing and building. My future goals are to work as a full-stack developer, but I also want to explore the world of robotics, including programming them and adding cool features.

Open to collaborating on cool projects. DM if interested in collaborating. I love and enjoy music. The 2010s are my vibe for music, with some traditional music as well. I have recently been interested in posting on Instagram about tech and random life stories. 🎶📚 I am a singer who enjoys singing, and I love books a lot.
